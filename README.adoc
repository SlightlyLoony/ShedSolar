== What is ShedSolar?

_ShedSolar_ is a program that provides several services related to the Outback solar system that I have installed in my shed:

* Controls the temperature of the batteries. My system has three Discover AES 7.4KWH LiFePO4 batteries. These batteries cannot be charged if their temperature is below 0C (32F), and they are not in a heated building. Here in our high northern Utah valley we routinely see temperatures as low as -15C (0F), so my system's batteries are inside an insulated box with a 200W heater. _ShedSolar_ will sense the battery temperature and turn the heater on as required to keep the battery temperature at an appropriate level. During hours when the sun is shining (and the batteries can therefore be charged), the battery temperature will be kept within the range of 15C to 20C (59F to 68F). Otherwise, the range will drop to 0C to 5C (32F to 41F) to lower the heater power requirements. It obtains the sunlight level from my weather system, which directly senses solar power with a pyrometer. The total time that the heater is powered on is tracked internally.
* Monitors the temperature of the batteries, providing alarm events for under-temperature (<0C, which might occur on heater failure) or over-temperature (>45C, which might occur if the batteries generate too much heat when the ambient temperature is high).
* Interrogates the Outback Mate3S every 60 seconds (by default) through the standard JSON API, processes the result, and holds it internally.
* Posts an event every 60 seconds. This event results in solar system data being published in our database.
* Publishes a solar system report message every 60 seconds, which any MOP client can subscribe to.

== Why does the world need ShedSolar?

Well, probably the world doesn't actually _need_ ShedSolar -- it's mainly here for the author's personal use and enjoyment, but with some faintish hope that someone else with the same challenges the author faced will also find it useful.

== Dependencies

ShedSolar has several dependencies:

* _MOP_ is a message-oriented programming module the author also wrote, freely available from https://github.com/SlightlyLoony/MOP[here].
* _Util_ is a utilities module the author also wrote, freely available from https://github.com/SlightlyLoony/Util[here].
* _JSON_ is the bog-standard Java JSON module, freely available from https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java[here].
* _commons-suncalc_ performs sun-related calculations, freely available from https://shredzone.org/maven/commons-suncalc/index.html[here]

== Why is ShedSolar's code so awful?

The author is a retired software and hardware engineer who did this just for fun, and who (so far, anyway) has no code reviewers to upbraid him. Please feel free to fill in this gap! You may contact the author at link:mailto:[tom@dilatush.com].

== Some implementation notesâ€¦

=== Hardware

The hardware used in this project, excluding cables and connections, is as follows:
* One Raspberry Pi 3B+ (with CanaKit wall wart power supply)
* Two Adafruit 269 thermocouple interfaces (MAX 31855 chip)
* Two type K thermocouples with 2 meter leads
* One AOLE ASH-10DA solid state relay (10 amp, 120VAC output, 3 volt input)
* One Omron LY2-UA-006244 relay
* Three 5mm LEDs (one green, two red)
* Three 220 ohm, 1/4 watt resistors

The Raspberry Pi is the heart of the system. One thermocouple and interface measures the temperature of the batteries (it's placed physically under a battery, where there is no air flow). The other thermocouple measures the air temperature at the output of the heater; this allows the Raspberry Pi to sense whether the heater is working. The solid state relay controls the heater. The electro-mechanical relay senses the output of the solid state relay; this allows the Raspberry Pi to sense whether the solid state relay is working. The author assumes that the two most likely failure points are (a) the heater, which has moving parts and hot parts, and (b) the solid state relay, simply because it's dealing with power lines. The LEDs are driving by software, with the following meanings:

* *Battery Temperature*: a 0.5 Hz flashing indicator whose duty cycle indicates the battery temperature: From 0% on to 100% on indicates 0C to 45C, which is the range of temperatures that my solar system batteries (Discover AES 42-48-6650 LiFePO4) may safely be charged. This LED fast-flashes if the battery temperature can't be read.
* *Heater Power*: this indicator is on when the heater has been turned on.
* *Status*: A flashing indicator that encodes some simple status information (see <<Status Codes>> section below).

=== Raspberry Pi I/O Usage

The following I/O pins are used for this project:

* *GPIO 14 / SCLK*: the SPI clock, to both thermocouple interfaces
* *GPIO 13 / MISO*: The SPI data in, to both thermocouple interfaces
* *GPIO 10 / CE0*: The SPI chip enable 0, to the battery thermocouple interface
* *GPIO 11 / CE1*: The SPI chip enable 1, to the heater thermocouple interface
* *GPIO 0*: Sense relay (pulled high, low means SSR is outputting 120VAC)
* *GPIO 2*: Battery Temperature LED (red), low is on
* *GPIO 3*: Heater Power LED (red), low is on
* *GPIO 4*: Status LED (green), low is on
* *GPIO 5*: Heater SSR, low is on

=== Status Codes

These are the codes displayed by the status indicator. There may be multiple status codes, in which case the status indicator will be off briefly between the codes. Once all the codes have been displayed, the status indicator will be off for a longer pause, then start over again. A short flash on indicates a zero, a long flash a one. The codes it can display are shown below. They are transmitted MSB first.
